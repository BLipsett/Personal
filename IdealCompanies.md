## Info Note
 - I am pretty impartial to who I think I would like to work for at this point. So for about half of my list I valued the companies for the fact they had offices abroad. Mainly in Europe. I assume it would be a long shot to get hired into one of those roles as a junior dev but maybe for the future.
