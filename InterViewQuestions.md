## Q. Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

- A. I generally worked on a team of about 3 or 4 at my previous employer and one of my team members was particularly difficult to work with. On a small team we all depended on each other though so after doing my best to try and learn about them I eventually found a few commonalities between us we could use to cancel out the many things we didn't.

## Q. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?

- A. During the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic I was activated by the state of New Hampshire to assist with the completely overwhelmed unemployment office and all the new cases. I was a call center rep with no experience speaking with people just trying to pay their mortgage. Many callers were upset and there was little I could do to help. Eventually I found if I let people vent and let them know their emotions were warranted they could start to have a conversation with me. Once we had a bit of a connection I could start to explain the limited information i had for them.

## Q. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

- A. Once during a pre-flight inspection an air-crew was performing. An issue arose that was in my area of expertise so I was called to inspect it. I diagnosed the issue to what I thought had faulted and informed the crew that they had to cancel the mission (not always easy to tell a high ranking officer what to do). As they began to shut-down I was conversing with a Boeing specialist on shift that realized there was actually a quick fix for it. I had to admit to the crew that I was wrong right away to get back on track and explain I did the best I could with the information I had at the time and I erred on the side of caution. They understood and I made sure to learn as much as I could from the specialist. 

## Q. Sometimes itâ€™s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?

- A. During my coding bootcamp there was an unfortunate alignment of time where things just seemed to converge at the same time. Once I realized the timeline I had to care of it I immediately set out to conquer it all as fast as I could. I started with what I wanted to see completed first and not what ultimately needed to happen first. After realizing some real prioritizing needed to happen I took care of what pertained to my health and well being first. Then moved to what was going to assist me accomplish more of my goals in the immediate future. Once my foundation was built I could move forward and although I didn't accomplish it all in the timeline i set for myself the timeline I did accomplish it was perfectly acceptable.

## Q. Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.

- A. While I certainly didn't dismiss any of my co-workers ideas on how to acccomplish the long list of tasks that needed to be done that day. I explained that we needed to priotize accuracy and completion first rather than just getting through everything and re-checking it tomorrow. I broke down everything into small feasible goals and let them use parts of they're original plan in bite size chunks so they could contribute in the game plan as well.
